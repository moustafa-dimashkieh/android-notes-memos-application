I created this app using Android Studio and utilized SQLite for database storage. In addition to this, I made use of shared preferences objects and both external and internal storage options in order to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly experience.

Upon opening the app, the user is presented with a login screen where they must enter their username and password in order to gain access to the main functionality of the app. Once logged in, the user is presented with a list of their existing notes, each displaying the title and date of creation. By pressing and holding a specific note, the user is given the option to edit or delete the note.

One of the key features of this app is the ability to export the notes as a CSV file. This is accomplished by including a button within the app that, when pressed, converts the data from the database into a CSV file which is then saved on the user's device. The user has the option to save the file to either the internal or external storage of their device.

Overall, I am confident that this Notes/Memos Android mobile app will provide a useful and convenient tool for individuals looking to keep track of their notes and memos in a digital format.
