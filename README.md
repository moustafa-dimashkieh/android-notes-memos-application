# Android-Notes-Application
In this project, I created a Notes/Memos android mobile application using Android Studio with SQLite as Database storage. I used as well the shared preferences objects and the external/internal storage. The application will have the following screens: a login screen with username and password authentication. Once the user is logged in; the application will display a list of existing notes displaying the title and the date of the note when the user press and holds a note; he should be presented with the edit and delete option and the last part of this project consist of exporting the notes into a CSV file, for this purpose, I added an export button to the application. When the export button is pressed, it will convert the data from the database into a CSV file that will be saved on the userâ€™s device (internal or external storage).
